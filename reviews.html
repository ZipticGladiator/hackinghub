                <h3>From Struggle to Security+</h3>
                <p class="testimonial-text">"Before joining Hacking Hub, I was studying in isolation. I would read a
                    chapter, get distracted, and lose momentum. The daily accountability check-ins changed everything
                    for me. Knowing I had to report my progress to the group kept me honest. I finally passed my
                    Security+ exam after 3 months of consistent effort, something I had been putting off for a year. The
                    community didn't just help me study; they helped me believe I could do it."</p>

                <h3>Landing the First Role</h3>
                <p class="testimonial-text">"I had the certs, but I couldn't get past the HR screen. The resume reviews
                    and mock interviews at Hacking Hub were a game changer. We sat down, tore apart my CV, and rebuilt
                    it to highlight my hands-on labs. The mock interviews were brutal but necessary. When I finally got
                    a real interview, I felt calm and prepared. I landed my first Junior Analyst role two weeks after
                    completing the 8-week challenge."</p>

                <h3>No More Gatekeeping</h3>
                <p class="testimonial-text">"I've been in other discord servers where senior members talk down to
                    beginners. Hacking Hub is different. It's a 'no gatekeeping' zone. When I got stuck on a TryHackMe
                    room, a Blue Team member jumped on a call with me and walked me through the methodology—not just
                    giving me the answer, but teaching me how to find it. That mentorship is priceless. I've grown more
                    in 6 months here than I did in 2 years on my own."</p>
